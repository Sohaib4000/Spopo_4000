QuantumPathEmperor

Overview

QuantumPathEmperor is an advanced quantum-classical hybrid solution for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with obstacle avoidance. It integrates Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Quantum Neural Networks (QNN) to provide highly optimized path planning.

Features

Quantum TSP Solver: Utilizes QAOA to generate an initial solution.

Quantum-Enhanced PSO: Leverages quantum computation to refine the solution.

Hybrid Quantum-Classical Learning: Implements a quantum neural network (QNN) in TensorFlow for further optimization.

Obstacle Avoidance: Uses local A* algorithm to ensure realistic path planning.

Supports GPU/TPU Acceleration for blazing-fast performance.


Technologies Used

Qiskit: Quantum computing framework for QAOA and QNN.

TensorFlow: Deep learning framework for hybrid learning.

Numba: High-performance JIT compilation.

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO): Classical optimization enhanced with quantum capabilities.

A Algorithm*: Pathfinding for obstacle avoidance.


Installation

pip install qiskit qiskit-machine-learning tensorflow numba pyswarm

Usage

from quantum_path_emperor import QuantumPathEmperor
import numpy as np

# Generate random cities and obstacle map
cities = np.random.rand(50, 2) * 100
obstacles = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=(100, 100), p=[0.8, 0.2])

# Initialize and solve
emperor = QuantumPathEmperor(cities, obstacles)
optimal_path = emperor.find_optimal_path()

print("Optimal path found:", optimal_path)

Applications

Smart logistics and delivery routing.

Robotics path planning.

AI-driven autonomous navigation.
